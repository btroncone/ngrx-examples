# @ngrx examples

[Angular 2](https://angular.io/) + [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) examples, inspired by official [redux examples](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples).

##Goal

These examples illustrate how to utilize ngrx within an Angular 2 application. This repository will be actively maintained and updated as new tools and functionality become available and best practices are established.

##Contributions

As Angular 2 and ngrx are relatively new, patterns and best practices are still being established. Examples found in this repository demonstrate how I (or the project author) would structure the solution but discussion and refinement is always encouraged! Please open an issue, submit a pull request, or drop me a message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/btroncone) to present a different approach or idea. This repository will feature the most solid, agreed upon techniques as they evolve.

Please add any additional Angular 2, ngrx, or reactive programming articles, repositories, or code samples you find useful. I will keep this list as up-to-date as possible!

##Getting Started
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/btroncone/ngrx-examples.git

# cd into repo
cd ngrx-examples

# cd into project of your choice
cd counter

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm start
```

##Build

Project builds are a stripped down version of [Angular Class Webpack Starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter), an exceptional Angular 2 seed project. Tests can be executed with either [WallabyJS](http://wallabyjs.com/) or Karma (soon!).

##Examples

### Counter
([source](https://github.com/btroncone/ngrx-examples/tree/master/counter))
#####Summary
A counter which can be incremented, decremented, with the option to increment or decrement async.
#####Demonstrates
1. Creating a basic reducer
2. Selecting a slice of state 
3. Using the async pipe
4. Dispatching actions from a component

### Todos
([source](https://github.com/btroncone/ngrx-examples/tree/master/todos))
#####Summary
Basic todo application with add, remove, and toggle complete functionality. 
#####Demonstrates
1. Initial reducer state
2. Managing arrays in reducers
3. Multiple reducers
4. Combining data from two reducers to project state for view

### Todos with Undo/Redo
([source](https://github.com/btroncone/ngrx-examples/tree/master/todos-undo-redo) | [plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/UnU1wnFcausVFfEP2RGD?p=preview))
#####Summary
Same as todos example but with undo/redo functionality.
#####Demonstrates
1. Creating a meta-reducer to add undo/redo capability.

### Async 
([source](https://github.com/btroncone/ngrx-examples/tree/master/async))
#####Summary
Request and display the latest Angular or React reddit posts, utilizing the reddit API.
#####Demonstrates
1. Handling async actions with @ngrx/effects
2. Conditionally making requests based on current state

### Shopping Cart

Request sample inventory, add and remove items from shopping cart, checkout.
#####Demonstrates

### Real World - In Progress!

### More to Come!
